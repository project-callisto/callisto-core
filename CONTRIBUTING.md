# Contributing to callisto-core

Thank you so much for considering contributing to callisto-core. We couldn't do the work that we do as a small tech nonprofit without the help of wonderful volunteers like yourself.

These guidelines are a work in progress and will be updated as we refine our contributing process. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

We're working on moving relevant issues from our private bug tracker over to the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SexualHealthInnovations/callisto-core/issues) on this repo. Beyond the features and bugs listed there, we would very much welcome contributions to improve our non-existent documentation, and are happy to provide extensive support!

#### How to submit
We need all contributors to sign our [volunteer agreement](https://github.com/SexualHealthInnovations/callisto-core/blob/master/shi-volunteer-agreement.pdf) (PDF) in order to accept contributions. Signed agreements can be submitted to tech@sexualhealthinnovations.org. We can take fixes to documentation without a signed agreement.
