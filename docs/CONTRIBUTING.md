# Contributing to callisto-core

Thank you so much for considering contributing to callisto-core. We couldn't do the work that we do as a small tech nonprofit without the help of wonderful volunteers like yourself.

## Your first contribution

Working on your first open source contribution? We are so excited to have you! You can learn how to make a pull request from this free course [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)!

## How to submit

We need all contributors to sign our [volunteer agreement](https://github.com/project-callisto/callisto-core/blob/master/docs/shi-volunteer-agreement.pdf) (PDF) in order to accept contributions. Signed agreements can be submitted to tech@projectcallisto.org. We can take fixes to documentation without a signed agreement.

## How to report a bug

**If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open a GitHub issue.** Email tech@projectcallisto.org instead. We will respond as soon as possible.

Other bugs or feature requests can be submitted as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/project-callisto/callisto-core/issues) on this repo.
